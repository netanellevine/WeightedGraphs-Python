## About

**Definition:**
A graph is a structure that is made up of **vertices** (also called nodes or points)
which are connected by **edges** (also called links or lines). A distinction is made between undirected graphs, where
edges link two vertices symmetrically, and directed graphs, where edges link two vertices
asymmetrically. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">see more on Graph Theory - Wikipedia</a><br>
<br>In this project we will illustrate to the best of our capabilities a ***Directed Weighted Graph*** and some familiar
Graphs Algorithms. <br>
<br>The graph resembles a small area with significant places and ways to transport between each place.  
This can be used for a variety of purposes (best route between cities,routes etc.).
<br>In our project we will try to simulate it as closely as can be to a small area as we said before.
